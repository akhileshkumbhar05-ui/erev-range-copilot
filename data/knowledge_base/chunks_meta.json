However, electrification efforts have typically focused on battery electric vehicles (BEVs); but extended-range EVs (EREVs), EVs with a backup gasoline generator, could play a major role. Nonetheless, reducing transportation-related costs and carbon emissions hinges on understanding how an EREV’s range and charging profile affect electric miles driven and, by extension, emission savings. This study evaluates the distribution of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) between electric and gasoline modes for EREVs across electric range (25–150 miles) and charging frequency scenarios. Using 2023 U.S. trip data by distance and monthly VMT benchmarks, we apply a dynamic mean- distance estimation method to match observed totals and allocate VMT to EV or gasoline power based on trip length.

Our results show, at current average efficiencies, that EREVs with a 50-mile range (13.7 kWh battery) could electrify 73.3% of national VMT, while 150-mile range EVs could electrify 86.8% illustrating that there are diminishing returns at higher ranges. We also compute corresponding carbon emissions savings using national fuel economy and emissions factors. Results highlight the nonlinear trade-offs between range and emissions reduction. Findings suggest that expanding the EREV range significantly boosts electrification potential up to 100 miles but offers marginal gains beyond. However, if users charge infrequently, larger range EVs are needed to maintain the benefits of vehicle electrification. Our results imply that policymakers and manufacturers should prioritize moderate range EREVs for households who frequently charge (e.g., homeowners) and long range BEVs for infrequent users (e.g., apartment dwellers).

Introduction The transportation sector accounts for a substantial share of global emissions, with light-duty vehicles (LDVs) being the major contributor [ 1]. Electrifying vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is thus a critical goal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net-zero targets [2]. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), including battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), have emerged as viable solutions, yet their environmental benefits depend heavily Energies2025,1, 0 https://doi.org/10.3390/en1010000 Energies2025,1, 0 2 of 21 on how they are used in real-world driving [ 1,3,4].

This study investigates how different battery sizes and corresponding ranges affect the percentage of VMT that are electrified, and how this, in turn, impacts costs, emissions, and installed battery capacity. While many models assume parity in usage between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), recent studies suggest that PEVs tend to be driven significantly less than gasoline cars [ 5,6]. Furthermore, trip assignment within multi-vehicle households often favors ICEVs for high-occupancy or longer trips due to range anxiety and charging infrastructure limitations [7,8]. These findings challenge earlier assumptions and demand updated, representative modeling of VMT distribution by powertrain and range [2,7]. Summary of key results.Our national model finds that, at national average efficiencies and costs, 50-mile range EREVs electrify 73.3% of VMT (2.391 T electric mi/yr), rising to 86.8% at 150 miles (2.83 T).

However, if users charge less frequently, then longer-range EVs are needed to maintain the benefits of electrification. These findings imply that frequent charging households could balance cost and benefits with moderate range EVs, while infrequent charging households need larger range EVs to maintain electrification benefits. 2. Background 2.1. Effects of EVs on Emissions A common assumption in electrification modeling is that each mile driven in an EV displaces one mile driven in a gasoline car. Recent research shows that this assumption is often unrealistic. Zhao et al. [ 6] quantified U.S. EV mileage and found that non-Tesla EVs were frequently driven less than comparable gasoline vehicles. Doshi and Metcalf [5] similarly highlighted large differences in usage across models. Early studies from the U.S. Department of Energy’s EV Project also reinforce this point: Smart et al.

Early studies from the U.S. Department of Energy’s EV Project also reinforce this point: Smart et al. [3,4] documented that Chevrolet Volt drivers often relied more heavily on gasoline than expected, with charging habits shaping the share of electric miles. Thus, environmental benefits depend on actual usage. 2.2. Balancing EV Costs with Their Benefits Although EVs offer greater efficiency and lower emissions than gasoline vehicles, their higher upfront cost—driven largely by batteries—remains a significant barrier [1,9]. Li et al. [10] showed that subsidies and charging infrastructure investments create strong indirect network effects. Zaino et al. [2] reviewed global EV adoption research and found that cost, policy design, and charging availability consistently dominate as the most important adoption factors. Governments’ interest in electrification is not only environmental; it is also industrial and strategic.

A recent cross-country review documents how purchase incentives, supply- chain localization, and charging-network investment are being combined with trade and industrial policies to capture value in batteries, power electronics, and software stacks [11]. Earlier work focused on developing economies shows similar policy bundles, emphasizing local content rules, tariff design, and public R&D to balance climate objectives with domestic competitiveness and job creation [12]. These studies motivate our cost-effectiveness framing: the relevant metric for policy is not battery capacity per se but electrified VMT and CO2 avoided per dollar of public and private expenditure.

[7] applied machine learning to U.S. households owning both EVs and ICEVs, showing that gasoline cars are often chosen for longer or higher-occupancy trips. In a companion study, the same authors [8] demonstrated that EV adoption preferences are strongly influ- enced by household composition and trip needs. Approximately 65% of U.S. households were owner-occupied in the last quarter of 2024. Owner-occupied households are more likely to have larger households, home charging, and more varied vehicle needs. These households, on average, have larger cars with more passenger capacity, higher towing capacity, and road trip capabilities (e.g., range and comfort). In contrast, renters generally have smaller, more efficient cars for mostly city driving and the occasional road trip. 2.4.

      "text": "offering a compromise between BEVs and conventional vehicles. EREVs are often called series hybrids and have similar equipment to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) in that they have a battery (albeit a larger one) and a gas engine. However, unlike PHEVs, EREVs are are propelled exclusively by the electric motors, which are powered by the battery; the gas engine serves only as a generator to recharge the battery. This means their operating profile is like that of a BEV , but with the ability to recharge on the go. However, to use both fuel systems, EREVs typically have much smaller batteries than BEVs (but much larger than PHEVs) and a much smaller engine than a typical ICE vehicle. This can reduce costs and material usage but could also reduce the positive impact of EV operations and the overall performance of the vehicle. Nonetheless, Subramanyam et al. [13] showed that EREVs can replace a substantial share of gasoline trips if integrated well. Yet EV Project data indicate that extended-range models may underdeliver their full electric potential if charging isinconsistent [3,4,36,37].

Control Strategy Matters for Realized Benefits Beyond hardware, energy management strategy strongly affects fuel use and emissions of EREVs. Liu et al. propose adaptive controllers that blend meta-heuristics (RF-IGWO, MGO) to allocate traction demand between the engine–generator and the battery under varying road grades and traffic [17]. Compared with rule-based baselines, such strategies reduce fuel consumption and emissions across multiple drive cycles by exploiting preview information and learning-based calibration [17].

Compact inductive power-transfer designs are reducing the size and materials cost of onboard receivers. Liang et al. demonstrate an integrated inductive–capacitive nanocrys- talline core aimed at higher power density and footprint reduction for IPT systems, a Energies2025,1, 0 4 of 21 direction that can ease vehicle packaging constraints [18]. Complementing static IPT, Wang et al. propose adynamicwireless-charging architecture—based on a flux-pipe supply rail and an H-type receiver—that targets more uniform output voltage as coupling changes during motion [19]. Together, these results indicate that as WPT matures (from stationary depots now to limited dynamic segments later), drivers can harvest more energyen route, reducing peak daily energy that must be carried onboard.

EV Load Handling and Power-System Implications 2.7.1. Coordinated charging and residential peak shaving. Beyond vehicle hardware, how EVs are scheduled to charge materially shapes grid impacts [35]. Malik, Mubashshir, and Lehtonen formulate a collaborative demand-response optimization that co-schedules EV charging with residential space-heating storage to shave evening peaks [ 20]. By jointly timing flexible thermal loads and EV charging, their framework reduces feeder peaks and shifts energy to lower-cost, lower-carbon hours—highlighting that operational coordination can deliver system benefits without new hardware. Implication for this study.Scenario comparisons of EV range should be interpreted alongside operational practices. With coordinated charging, the system can accommodate higher electrified VMT at lower marginal grid cost and emissions than naïve “charge whenever” baselines [20]. 2.7.2.

Fast-charging congestion and queuing control. At public DC fast-charging hubs, service discipline and power allocation determine driver wait times and station utilization. Malik and Lehtonen model fast-charging as a queuing/scheduling problem and propose control strategies that minimize expected waiting time by adapting charging-slot allocation and power sharing across plugs [ 21]. Such policies reduce congestion at peak periods and make better use of installed capacity. Implication for this study.When fast-charging is coordinated (rather than first-come, fixed-power), realized travel electrification improves for a given station footprint. Our cost- effectiveness metrics (USD/tCO2 and USD/electric miles) therefore reflect an operational upside that complements hardware-only comparisons [21]. 2.8.

VMT Calculations We start by dividing the trip distances into 9 bins that align with our datasets, see Table 1. From the datasets, we know how many trips are made by each trip distance bin, so we calculated an average mileage for each bin using bounded least squares, in order to minimize the difference between the reported VMT and our calculated VMT, which is the optimized average multiplied by the number of trips. Therefore, for each EV range (50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 miles), we calculate the following: • Electric VMT: All miles in bins where round-trip distance is less than or equal to EV range. • Gasoline VMT: The difference between the trip distance and EV miles for trips that exceed EV range.

Annual Trips and Modeled VMT by Distance Bin In order to calculate how often an EREV runs on electricity, and by extension the ratio of electric to gas VMT, we had to disaggregate VMT by trip distance. Table 1 shows the Energies2025,1, 0 7 of 21 trip distance by bin and total number of trips provided by [22] and shows our estimated average bin distances that allowed us to calculate a VMT by trip distance. Table 2 shows how our estimated VMT by month compares with the actual VMT by month provided by [23]. Our model goal was to minimize the sum of the squared error over the year, modifying one average bin distance for the year that was applied to every month.

In this table, we assume that the 50-mile EV range EREV charges before each trip and calculate what percentage of the VMT in each trip distance bin would be met by electricity. We then multi",

In this table, we assume that the 50-mile EV range EREV charges before each trip and calculate what percentage of the VMT in each trip distance bin would be met by electricity. We then multiplied that percentage by the total VMT in that bin to get the EV VMT. Gas VMT is simply the Total VMT subtracted by the EV VMT. 4.1.1. Validation Against FHWA Monthly VMT When identifying an average bin distance, we evaluated the bin sizes monthly as well as yearly. While the monthly is more accurate for the year it is trained, it overfits for that given year. Fixed bin widths are more flexible for yearly variations and should be easier to reproduce. While seasonal distances are important as seasonality also affects range, the developed charging and efficiency scenarios will capture variation in electrified VMT more efficiently than overfitting the average bin distance would.

Factors, Assumptions, and Sources In order to calculate emissions, battery size, capital cost, operating cost, and other metrics, we identified average values from various sources for key parameters. However, some of these parameters vary or could possibly vary in the future, so in order to explore a Energies2025,1, 0 8 of 21 broad range of future outcomes, we created three scenarios: worst, average, and best. The worst scenario explores cases where electric vehicles are, on average, inefficient, battery packs are expensive, and electricity is expensive, but ICEVs are efficient, and gas is cheap. The average scenario uses nationwide averages for all parameters. The best scenario assumes that electric vehicles are more efficient than average, electricity is relatively cheap, the grid has a low carbon intensity, ICEVs are inefficient, and gas is expensive. This is shown in Tables 4. Table 4.Emission and cost factors used in CO2 and cost calculations. Source column added per guida",

Small ranges account for the majority of VMT electrification. A 50-mile EREV yields an EV share of 73.3% and 2.39 trillion electric miles annually, with 573.9 Mt CO 2 avoided (national averages). 2. Diminishing Returns: More battery capacity is needed to electrify the next mile. Using national averages, Fleet Wh Battery Capacity per electric VMT increases from USD 1.097 (50 mi) to USD 3.291 (150 mi), i.e., each additional electric mile requires more battery as the range grows. 3. Costs escalate nonlinearly. Using national averages, fleet pack CAPEX per electric mile rises from USD 0.161/mi (50 mi) to USD 0.409/mi (150 mi), and the battery capex per ton of CO2 saved rises from USD 712/t to USD 1802/t. Gains in electric miles flatten after ∼100–125 miles (EV VMT increases by +320 B from 50→100, but only +121 B from 100→150), while battery requirements continue to climb (battery capacity from 3.6 [50 mi] to 10.7 TWh [150 mi]).

Transportation Emissions by Subsector The inspiration of this work was to see how transportation emissions, the largest emit- ting sector (28%) in the US, can be reduced. LDVs account for about 57% of transportation emissions as illustrated by Figure 1 which shows all categories of emissions in transporta- tion: rail, watercraft, aircraft, and ground transportation, with ground transportation being by far the largest. Figure 1 illustrates how electrifying (or partially electrifying) light-duty vehicles could reduce LDV emissions by more than half, putting them in line with the emissions produced Energies2025,1, 0 11 of 21 by trucks and aircraft, which have orders of magnitude fewer vehicles and total VMT. Future work, can investigate how electrification (or partial electrification) of medium to heavy duty trucks, aircraft, watercraft, and rail could reduce those subsectors emissions in a similar way.

Battery Capacity and Capital Cost Figure 2 shows how many TWh of batteries would be required to transform all LDVs to an EREV with a given range. The scenarios—worst, average, and best—correspond to ranges for electric vehicle efficiency. These results show that efficiencies matter for battery size, and these effects magnify at higher vehicle ranges. All charging frequency cases will have an installed battery capacity equal to the average (blue) scenario because only efficiency and range affect battery size. Figure 2.Installed battery capacity (TWh) vs. EV range by scenario. Figure 3 illustrates the cost of electrifying the entire LDV fleet by EV range and scenario. Larger batteries are needed for lower efficiency, which increases the capital cost of EREVs.

Charging Pattern and VMT Shares We calculated the electric and gas VMT by creating weekly driving profiles where we divided the total number of yearly trips in each trip distance bin by the number of drivers and then by the number of weeks for all trip distances less than 100 miles. These values are shown in Table 3. We distributed those trips across the week to realistically match the average household’s weekly trip pattern. For instance, mid-range trips that resemble commute distances, we aligned with the weekdays. Shorter trips, which could be school pickups or grocery store trips, were spread through weekdays. Slightly longer short trips and slightly longer than commute distance trips were spread over the weekend. This distribution ended up with a relatively even distance traveled per day of about 75 miles. We excluded trips over 100 miles from the weekly profile for two reasons. One, we calculated the trips over 100 miles to be relatively rare (less than 1 per week), and calculating the VMT for a partial trip would create an unrealistic profile.

Two, it is reasonable to assume that if a driver knows they are going on a long trip, they would plan ahead and charge before the trip. Therefore, we assumed drivers would have a normal charging schedule during the week for shorter trips that would not be interrupted by the occasional long trip. We calculated the EV VMT for longer trips by only assuming that the first part of the round-trip started with a full battery and assigned the difference as Gas VMT. So if a driver took a 200-mile round-trip on the weekend and their EREV has a 50-mile range, then we assumed that 150 miles of that trip used gas. Figure 4 shows the weekly charging scenarios.

The results illustrate that the CO2 savings offered by EREVs are dependent on the efficiency of gas and electric vehicles as well as the grid carbon intensity. If the EREVs are of average efficiency and charged by an average grid (middle columns), then they provide massive CO2 savings. However, if the ICE fleet becomes dramatically more efficient and the electricity grid becomes dirtier, for instance, because of increased coal electricity generation, then the CO 2 savings vanish (left columns).

Note that in the worst case, for all EREV ranges, the emissions are extremely close to the ICE emissions. However, our parameterization has electricity emissions just a little less than gasoline emissions, which means that any electrified emissions will be slightly better than ICE emissions for our defined worst case. However, if the national average grid intensity is raised to 800 g CO 2 / kWh, the electric vehicle efficiency is dropped to 2.8 mi/kWh, or the average ICE fleet mpg is raised above 37, then EREVs would emit more. While we believe this scenario is unlikely, it is important to point out that there are scientifically feasible scenarios where EREVs and EVs could emit more than ICEVs.

The results show that the CO2 savings offered by EREVs are dependent on how often they charge, which affects how many miles are electric versus gas. Less frequent charging results in more Gas VMT, which results in higher emissions. Higher-range EREVs mitigate or eliminate this impact, as shown by the small (or zero) increase in Gas VMT when the charging frequency drops from seven to five or five to three, in line with EREV ranges of 125 and 150.

Conclusions Our results show that vehicle electrification always provides some carbon emission benefits under current conditions.

However, the battery capital cost per ton of CO2 avoided escalates from 0.072 USD/kg CO2 at 50 mi to 0.182 USD/kg CO2 at 150 mi, and installed battery capacity per electric mile more than doubles. Using national average electricity prices and efficiencies and assuming a charging frequency that maximizes electric VMT, the operating cost for electric miles averages 4–8 ¢/mi, compared with 11.4 ¢/mi for ICEVs. Therefore, for frequent chargers, moderate-range EREVs (100–125 mi) achieve the best balance between emissions reduction and total battery investment. Nonetheless, charging frequency shapes real-world performance and experiences. Our results show that drivers who charge fewer than five times per week can lose up to 75% of potential electrified miles while increasing the unit cost per electric mile and ton of CO2 saved.

Contrary to common assumptions, these results imply that less frequent chargers (e.g., renters, apartment dwellers) do not benefit from dual-fuel flexibility, as it is costlier and less efficient. Infrequent chargers either need more electric range to electrify the VMT between their charging sessions, or they will use more gas, which severely diminishes the efficiency and emission benefits of low-to moderate range EREVs. Therefore, BEVs provide more cost-effective benefits for infrequent chargers since they have more electric range, which allows for less frequent charging. However, in order to be attractive, these BEVs must be efficient and cost-effective, which implies smaller vehicles. Furthermore, because infrequent chargers will require more energy during each charge session, since they drive further between charges, the refuel rate (energy/time) must be fast enough to prevent long refuel times that drive down adoption.
